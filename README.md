This is license for software, slightly more restrictive WTFNMFPLv3. License is licensed under WTFPLNMFv3.
WTFNMFPLv3 basically is public domain.
WTF-NMF-CA-PLv4 is same, but it aims software explicitly, and has added restriction of leaving contributors and giving them credit in subsequent forks, and ensuring this license stays, but explicitly protects people who don't want publish their code (closed-source, ie. for commercial use).

It's still very liberal license.
